# Code Challenges
Learning Days 2.0 - team-wide learning through our weekly [#dev-challenge](https://useed.slack.com/messages/dev-challenge/).

# Contributiung
## Questions
To create a new question, simply add a new folder to the `questions` directory. You should include a README.md file which explains the question, parameters of the solution, and any resources associated with the question.

## Solutions
Provide your solutions in the questions directory. Use a file or directory naming convention that contains your GitHub username.

## Guidelines
The following "rules" help guide our learning:

* Questions will be selected on Mondays.
* When possible, the team will review solutions on Fridays.
* In finding and developing your solution, you should pair with another member of the team at least once.
* Challenge yourself! Can easily do it in Ruby? Try another language!
* Keep track of how you found the solution: what worked / what didn't?
